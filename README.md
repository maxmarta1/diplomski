This is my bachelor thesis code and paper. For my bachelorâ€™s thesis I worked on extraction of vital signs from FMCW radar recorded signals where participants were children of different age. Further I did age group classification using a LSTM neural network as well as convolutional neural networks. Code is written in Python and MATLAB.
